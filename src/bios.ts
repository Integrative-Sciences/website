        "bio": "Otávio Cabral-Marques is a scientist in immunology and psychology whose research advances integrative, systems-level approaches to human health. He is Professor of Molecular Medicine in the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of São Paulo’s School of Medicine (FM-USP) and a researcher at the D’Or Institute for Research and Education (IDOR). His work brings together psychoneuroimmunology, multi-omics and network science to elucidate immune responses and molecular mechanisms across psychiatry, infection, autoimmunity and cancer. Trained in both Biology and Psychology, Cabral-Marques earned his MSc and PhD in Immunology at USP, with doctoral research at the University of Washington School of Medicine and Seattle Children’s Research Institute, followed by postdoctoral fellowships in Brazil and Germany (Universities of Lübeck and Freiburg). As editor, he champions rigorous interdisciplinary science, fostering discoveries that connect molecules, circuits and behavior with clinical relevance.",

Schimke holds a medical degree and a PhD in Medicine from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (2011), followed by residency training in Immunology and Rheumatology at the University of Lübeck and the University of Freiburg (2015–2019). She completed two postdoctoral fellowships at the Institute of Biomedical Sciences of the University of São Paulo (2011–2015; 2019–2024), focusing on infectious diseases, inborn errors of immunity, and systems biology. Her research integrates high-throughput data analysis, bioinformatics, and systems immunology to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying chronic infectious and autoimmune diseases. She has been awarded research funding from several leading national and international agencies, including the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID), the Latin American Society for Immunodeficiencies (LASID), Dimension Sciences, the Clinical Scientist program of the University of Lübeck, the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq). In addition to her academic trajectory, she practices as a clinician and rheumatologist in specialized medical centers.",
